# DEND_P5

### SUMMARY

In this project we use _airflow_ as workflow engine to execute different tasks to load RedShift Tables.

### BEFORE ANYTHING ...

In order to make easier this project implementation, we have used docker containers to create all the environment.
Refer 2 the following links to make it work by docker-compose:

* https://www.docker.com/
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/

Once is done:

```
docker-compose up -d 
```

and go to http://localhost:8080 to see Airflow's web console
